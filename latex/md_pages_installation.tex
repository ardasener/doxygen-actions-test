\doxysection*{Dependencies}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A reasonably recent C++ compiler with Open\+MP support.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tested with {\ttfamily clang 7.\+0.\+1-\/8} and {\ttfamily gcc 8.\+2.\+0}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item GNU Make (optional) (highly recommended)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tested with version {\ttfamily 4.\+2.\+1}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Nvidia Cuda Toolkit (optional)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tested with release {\ttfamily 9.\+2}
\item An Nvidia GPU is also necessary (does not need to be too recent).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysection*{Compilation}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Simply running {\ttfamily make} or {\ttfamily make std} will compile a standard version of the program.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The only parallism used in this form is Open\+MP.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Running {\ttfamily make cuda} will compile a CUDA assisted version.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This should result in significant speedups.
\item However it does require {\ttfamily Nvidia Cuda Toolkit} and an Nvidia GPU.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Code can be compiled without make, using the commands in the makefile manually.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysection*{Command Line Arguments}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/help} \+: Displays all the arguments.
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/gc} \+: Generates a default config file.
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/cf \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}file\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}\+: Specify the config file to be used.
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/dd \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}directory\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}\+: Specify the directory with the input data files in it.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysection*{Configuration}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Generally you should start by running the program with the {\ttfamily -\/-\/gc} argument. This will create a {\ttfamily config.\+toml} file in the current directory.
\item The file itself contains comments explaining all the options.
\item An example of the file is included below. This might be out of date so do not directly use it.
\item Once generated and modified this file must be given with the {\ttfamily -\/-\/cf} argument.
\item Also a directory containing the {\ttfamily courses.\+json}, {\ttfamily classrooms.\+json}, {\ttfamily concurrency.\+json} files must be given with {\ttfamily -\/-\/dd}. (Refer to the data section for more info)
