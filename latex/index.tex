\doxysection*{External Libraries Used}

\doxysubsection*{json}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/nlohmann/json}}
\item Used for reading the input data.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsection*{random}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/effolkronium/random}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/effolkronium/random}}
\item The {\ttfamily rand} function is not thread safe as a result performs poorly in our application.
\item This library wraps c++11 {\ttfamily random} library to provide a simpler and optionally thread safe interface.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsection*{args}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/Taywee/args}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Taywee/args}} ~\newline

\item Simple argument parser.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsection*{cpptoml}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/skystrife/cpptoml}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/skystrife/cpptoml}}
\item Used for reading the config files.
\item JSON could also be used for this but TOML format seems to better for config files since it allows for comments.
